### What Is Infrastructure as Code?

To overcome the shortcomings of the manual provisioning approach, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice in which you manage and provision your infrastructure components—such as servers, networks, and storage—using code and software development techniques rather than manually configuring hardware and systems.

Simply, it means you write scripts or configuration files describing how your servers, networks, and other resources should be set up. This approach allows you to automate the deployment and management of your infrastructure, making it more efficient, consistent, and scalable. By treating infrastructure like software code, you can version control, share, and replicate it easily across different environments, reducing errors and saving time.
