## Chapter Overview 

Managing IT infrastructure can be complicated, but Infrastructure as Code (IaC) makes it easier to define infrastructure using code. In this chapter, you’ll learn what IaC is, why it’s important, and how it helps manage infrastructure faster, more reliably, and more easily scale. You’ll also explore two main ways to write IaC: declarative, where you describe the desired outcome, and imperative, where you list the steps to get there.

Next, we’ll introduce OpenTofu, a popular open source IaC tool. You’ll see what makes OpenTofu unique and how it compares to similar tools like Terraform. By the end of this chapter, you’ll know how to install OpenTofu, set it up, and use it to write and manage infrastructure using its basic workflow: writing configurations, planning changes, applying them, and removing resources when needed.
