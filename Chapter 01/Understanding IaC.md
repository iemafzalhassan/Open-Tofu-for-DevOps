### Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Infrastructure Provisioning: The Manual Way
Applications fuel the growth and efficiency of modern businesses. They depend on infrastructure—such as compute, storage, and networking—to run effectively. Traditionally, system administrators and IT professionals managed this infrastructure manually, physically setting up servers, network devices, and other hardware components needed for business applications.

In the early days, every business application required dedicated physical hardware. This meant deploying and configuring individual servers for each application—a time-intensive and resource-heavy process. Virtualization revolutionized this approach by allowing multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server using hypervisors, making better use of underutilized hardware. Despite this innovation, infrastructure provisioning and configuration were still mostly done manually, which brought its own set of challenges.

  <summary>Human Error</summary>
  Each step must be carefully executed, and even small errors can result in system failures or inconsistent environments. Manual processes are prone to mistakes, such as typos or misconfigurations, which can lead to system failures or security vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Inconsistency</summary>
  Without standardized processes and procedures, different administrators might configure systems differently, leading to difficult-to-troubleshoot inconsistencies. Manual setups make reproducing identical testing, staging, and production environments extremely difficult. Differences in configurations can lead to bugs that only appear in specific environments.

  <summary>Scalability Issues</summary>
  Manually scaling infrastructure is impractical in today’s fast-paced world of modern applications. Cloud environments and microservices architectures require rapid and often automated scaling, which manual processes struggle to support.

<details>
  <summary>Time Consumption</summary>
  Manually setting up and configuring servers, storage, and networks takes significant time and effort. For example, routine tasks like provisioning a server could take hours or days, slowing down the deployment of applications and features.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Limited Agility</summary>
  Manual provisioning relies heavily on the expertise of individual administrators. Poor documentation or a lack of standardized processes can make collaboration and troubleshooting difficult. As such, responding to business needs or technological changes requires a lot of work, which affects competitiveness and innovation.

Manual provisioning provides hands-on control over every step, making it possible to handle unique or non-standard configurations that might not fit automation scripts. For beginners, manually setting up infrastructure can provide valuable insights into the underlying components and how they work together, building a good foundation for understanding automated tools.

While manual provisioning worked well in legacy systems and simpler IT setups, it has significant drawbacks in modern application development and deployment. Infrastructure as Code offers a solution that automates infrastructure management, ensuring speed, consistency, and scalability in a way manual processes cannot match.
